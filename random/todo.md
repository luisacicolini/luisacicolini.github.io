- [ ] daniel kroening talk:
    1. bv api -> table + plots, missing theorems
              -> smtlib 2.7: overflow -> LLVM dialect uses them (example)
              -> bitwuzla rewrites/canonicalization 
              -> fast circuit
    2. all this is useful to have circt semantics in lean 
              -> comb dialect: example, bv decide 
              -> dc/handshake: lift bitvecs into streams

    - iterative squaring, take transition relation and symcompute the relation? for bdds
