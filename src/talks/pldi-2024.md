## Recent Advances in Floating-point (Static) Analyses

## SpEQ: Translation of Sparse Codes using Equivalences

- Nasa Parallel Benchmarks!!
- verify sparsity → equivalence check between dense and compressed = precondition for sparsity over input data → stuttering bisimulation
- semantics is important and can be an interesting proxy for optimizations

## Compiling with Abstract Interpretation

- ai framework for compilation + use comp result to improve ai
- ai = combine multiple analyses to collaborate/increase precision → can it be used for transformations?
- free algebra domains generate programs as analysis result + domain functors for comp passes + online comp to SSA
- ai: propagate analysis until fixed point

## Towards Trustworthy Automated Program Verifiers: Formally Validating Translations into an Intermediate Verification Language

- soundness of intermediate verification language program = frontend + backend
- frontend soundness: ivl correct ⇒ backend correct
- pb: no formal guarantees on implementations in practice + nontrivial implementations
- cont: simulation methodology for source and ivl + certifying adaptation of viper-to-boogie translation
- very interesting choice of ordering: first cont + results then challenges
- ch1: semantic gap viper-boogie
- ch2: diversity
- ch3: non locality
- pb: relating viper method and boogie procedure → p simulates m = decompose simulation into small semantic concerns + tactics for simulation of resulting concerns

## Verified Extraction from Coq to OCaml

- hand writing = control of optimization + bugs
- solution: high level languages
- pb: verifying aggressively opt compilers is very hard
- first work: 2 stage compiler for hig level func lang + combinators to tinker with lowerl level details = verified
- now the lowering algo is verified
- reshape operators (invertible) → rewrite framework exploiting verified equivalences
