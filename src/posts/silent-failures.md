It's important to acknowledge *why* things go wrong, instead of acknowledging a failure and just move on with life. People don't always do that, but it's actually important (especially when working in a group, especially when working in a group of *opinionated people*). Being aware of why things go wrong helps us understand how to avoid similar failures.
It seems like people don't always *actually* want what they claim they want: it's important to reflect on *actions* besides words.
If you say you want something, but don't get it when presented with an opportunity, it might be the case to reflect on *why* you want it and what you *expect* from it.
We all see benefits in the things we want, it's important to reflect on what these are and what can satisfy them.

The best way to do something is to actually start doing it.
