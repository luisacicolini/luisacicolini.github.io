## Nice to meet you!
My name is Luisa, I am an automata and formal methods enthusiast - currently on a quest to learn more about logics
and maths. 
I also enjoy painting, sewing clothes and music - I played the piano and sang in various bands for a long time, and still love doing it when I get the chance to!

I'm currently a research assistant at the university of Cambridge, here's a bit of what i've been up to lately:
