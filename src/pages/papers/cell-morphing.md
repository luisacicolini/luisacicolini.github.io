title : "cell morphing: from array programs to array-free horn clauses - d. monniaux et al."
---
From our programs with arrays, we generate nonlinear Horn clauses over scalar variables only,in a common format with clear and unambiguous logical semantics, for which there exist several solvers. We thus avoid the use of solvers operating over arrays, which are still very immature.
