The proposed method tries to find inconsistencies between the specification and FSM implementation through manipulation of respective polynomials.
Security properties (such as a safe transition to a protected state) are derived using specification polynomials and verified against implementation polynomials. In a case of a failure, the vulnerability is reported. While existing methods can verify legal transitions, our approach tries to solve the important and non-trivial problem of detecting illegal accesses to the design states (e.g., protected states).
