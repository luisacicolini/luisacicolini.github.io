# [cell morphing: from array programs to array-free horn clauses](https://hal.science/hal-01206882v1/file/arrays_Horn_article.pdf)
a paper by d. monniaux, l. gonnord 

From our programs with arrays, we generate nonlinear Horn clauses over scalar variables only,in a common format with clear and unambiguous logical semantics, for which there exist several solvers. We thus avoid the use of solvers operating over arrays, which are still very immature.
