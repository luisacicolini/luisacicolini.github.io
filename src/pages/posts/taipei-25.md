# things to do in taipei 

**Taipei** is a very safe and interesting city (at least in my experience): I took a day before the conference to visit it and was not disappointed. 
I especially appreciated brewing tea in a [quiet and small tea house](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g13811269-d8593098-Reviews-Qinhtian_Tea_House-Da_an_Taipei.html) and a lovely walk through the tea plantation in [Maokong](https://english.gondola.taipei/) (with more tea, obviously).
The night markets are also definitely worth a visit: meals there are delicious and cheap, with great food variety: I saw so many things I can't really name!
Taiwan in general seems to have a lot to offer, and I hope to be back, maybe for a trek or some surf lessons :)
